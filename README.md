## ❖・Instructions・❖

Your task is to create a web site of Dieter Rams’s ten principles for good design. All ten are included in the accompanying file `ten-principles-for-good-design.txt`. You can create a single page site containing all ten rules, or a single site consisting of ten pages. Your project must consist of the contents in the file `ten-principles-for-good-design.txt` and a navigation system, at the very least. Including open source images is encouraged.

## ❖・Project Scaffold・❖

This repo contains a folder called `site`, which, in turn, contains some starter files for this project. (See the **File List** section below.)

### File List

1. `README.md`
2. `ten-principles-for-good-design.txt`
3. `site/css/reset.css`
4. `site/css/style.css`
5. `site/index.html`
6. `site/img/`

## ❖・The Rules・❖

* Only submit files that are required by your project; Do not submit working files, such as `.psd`, `.ai`, `.indd`, or `.sketch` files.
* Use lowercase, combined with kebab case, to name folders and files (`do-this` or `do-this.html`); no spaces in folder or file names (`not this`); no camel case (`notThis`); no snake case (`not_this`).
* Do not alter or remove the `reset.css` file in the `css` folder.
* Do not alter or remove any of the `.gitignore` files.
* You must use at most two typefaces. Look to [`https://fonts.google.com/`](https://fonts.google.com/) for ideas.
* You must use at most two colors, in addition to a neutral. Look to [`https://color.adobe.com/`](https://color.adobe.com/) for ideas.
* Your site’s UI must be logical, clear, and easy to use.
* All your HTML files must go in the root of the `site` folder, with the `index.html` file acting as the springboard for your site.
* All your CSS must be placed in the `css` folder.
* Any images you might use must be placed in the `img` folder.
* Any images you include **must** be smaller than 1MB.
